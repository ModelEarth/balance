### Data Sources
<!--Food Balance Visualization-->
Our ModelEarth team is building [nutrition profiles from YAML and json](/data-commons/dist/food/) for balanced meals using the [USDA API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html).

[Data.World Food Nutrition Data](https://data.world/adamhelsinger/food-nutrition-information)
Data for raw fruits and vegetables is used here in the balance repo created by Rakesh.

[USDA Food Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html)
Four categories of foods are updated every quarter. (Also used in the balance repo.) Let's use the API in real-time too.

[Google Data Commons](https://datacommons.org)
Find nutritional profile data including minerals (calcium, sodium, zinc etc).
